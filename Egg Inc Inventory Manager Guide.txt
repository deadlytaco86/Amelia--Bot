All modules needed for the bot are imported.

Next, all artifacts, stones and ingredients are defined as well as all legendary artifact types.

How the bot pulls and sorts artifact data:
when get_full_inventory() is called the bot will request game data from the API. The inventory is then isolated.
From there, we will get the artifact key indices. These indices indicate when a new artifact entry begins in the inventory.
Using the indices, the type, level and quantity as well as rarity are pulled. If an artifact has stones those will be extracted as well.
The data is then formatted using the following format:
name : [type, quantity, slotted stones]
the name encodes the following information: base name of artifact, tier, level and rarity. ex: T4R Tungsten Ankh -> tier 4 rare tungsten ankh.
This data is saved in a json file.
